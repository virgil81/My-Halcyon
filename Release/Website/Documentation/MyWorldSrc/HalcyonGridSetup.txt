Grid services and Regions are set up to use Region folders for the regions and each region gets its startup info from the grid website.
That is identified in the Region.ini override for Halcyon.ini located in the C:\Grid folder.
Region folder layout:
 C:\Grid\
  Bin - for Aperture for now. May become code source for all regions.
  <port#> - For region specific data controls. Also has all the code placed there for now.
 Using the port numbers assigned to each region is done so the ports used can be easily seen and they dont change when regions get renamed or relocated in the grid. 

 Update.bat is to update the Halcyon code in each of the region folders:
  command: Update <halcyonversion>
  Where the <halcyonversion> comes from the folder name of the Halcyon version to install in the C:\Updates folder. 
 Only the newest and the most recent two halcyon versions are retained. The Updates folder is where you want to upload updates and accessed by Filezilla FTP control. It services all the Halcyon grids for one upload point of access. Until alternative methods are setup for Halcyon, the source code must be compiled on another matching 64 bit processor for Windows .Net and Linux Mono editions to be updated in each of the Halcyon running VMs.
 
 The starting template config files needed for each grid are listed below. Some will be placed in the GridHost folder and most used in the Grid Services installation.
 Halcyon.ini is to be placed in the region server C:\Grid folder and the grid services location folder.
 The Region.ini is the template for each region to be set up, placed in its folder named by port number.
 Aperture.ini is placed in each Region server in C:/Grid/Bin folder.

 Replacement tags and files they are in:
  Tag               Files                                              Comment
  %RegionServerIP%  - Halcyon.ini                                      Replaced with region server's External IP.
  %GridServerIP%    - MessagingServer_Config.xml                       Replaced with grid server's External IP.
  %GridName%        - Halcyon.ini, UserServer_Config.xml               as in "IMA %GridName% Grid".
  %GridNick%        - Halcyon.ini                                      Grid short name ie. MyWorld.
  %DBLocalIP%       - Halcyon.ini, *_Config.xml                        MySQL Server internal IP address.
  %GridDB%          - Halcyon.ini, *_Config.xml                        DB name for the grid database. No spaces. Ie. mydata
  %DBUser%          - Halcyon.ini, *_Config.xml                        DB User name for grid access. NOT ROOT!
  %DBPass%          - Halcyon.ini, *_Config.xml                        DB Connection string that identifies the DB user password.
  %ServicesLocalIP% - Halcyon.ini, *_Config.xml                        Internal IP address for the grid services VM.

  %WhipPass%        - Halcyon.ini, GridServer_Config.xml, aperture.cfg Whip service password ie: MyWhipPass
  %WhipLocalIP%     - Halcyon.ini, GridServer_Config.xml, aperture.cfg whip internal IP ie: 10.0.0.20
    Or both may be replaced at once. ie: %WhipPass%@%WhipLocalIP% to MyWhipPass@10.0.0.20

  %WebsiteURL%      - Halcyon.ini, Region.ini, UserServer_Config.xml   Website name ie: %WebsiteURL% = http://www.MyWorld.com
  %GridLogonURL%    - Halcyon.ini                                      login URL for the grid ie: %GridLogonURL% = http://Logon.MyWorld.com, %GridLogonURL%:8002 -> http://Logon.MyWorld.com:8002
  %BankUserUUID%    - Halcyon.ini                                      Bank account UUID or set to nothing. Used only if Economy is set in the website is displayed there.
  %RegIntIP%        - Region.ini                                       The region server Internal IP
  %port%            - Region.ini                                       The region server Port for region connection.

Region port numbers start at 9500 but must be unique port numbers even when on different region servers if the regions can be seen from a viewer or it causes the regions to blank out randomly.
 
Each Windows region server must have the firewall opened for the actual ports used. ie.

Halcyon DB creation utility:
hc-database --init --type=core --host=localhost --schema=%GridDB% --user=root --password=<rootpass>
Run this from the bin folder in a command prompt to create the grid database.

Run the following in MySQL Workbench query to create the DB user and assign permissions.

create user '%DBUser%'@'%' identified by '%DBPass%';
grant Select, Insert, Update, Delete on %GridDB%.* to '%DBUser%'@'%';
grant Select, Insert, Update, Delete on mysite.* to '%DBUser%'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

****************************************
Recommendations:
Document as above for each region server and the regions it hosts. 
This documentation will save you much time and frustration in finding sources of problems with operation.
Each region that is located next to any other region requires a unique port number assigned to it, 
even if it is on a different server!
I run a max of 10 regions of any type on one region server. 
Performance for maximum number of users will vary depending on server abilities.

Thus if a second region server was set up, its region port numbers would be like:
Region1: 9510
Region2: 9511
Region3: 9512

***************
SetPorts4User.cmd - This file is used to set the region server grid ports for current server user. Execute file from command line.
Contents like this for each port:
***************
netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:9500/ user=%USERNAME%

***************
Desktop Icon Setup:
***************

This documents how to set up desktop icons to use start up parms with a batch file to run a region.
NOTE: Change path to match your installation!!

Region Icon Properties:
Target: C:\Grid\Halcyon.bat --inimaster=..\Halcyon.ini --inifile=Region.ini
Start in: C:\Grid\9500

Target: C:\Grid\Halcyon.bat --inimaster=..\Halcyon.ini --inifile=Region.ini
Start in: C:\Grid\9501

Target: C:\Grid\Halcyon.bat --inimaster=..\Halcyon.ini --inifile=Region.ini
Start in: C:\Grid\9502

Target: C:\Grid\Halcyon.bat --inimaster=..\Halcyon.ini --inifile=Region.ini
Start in: C:\Grid\9503

Target: C:\Grid\Halcyon.bat --inimaster=..\Halcyon.ini --inifile=Region.ini
Start in: C:\Grid\9504

...

The commandline parms provide the location of the Master Halcyon.ini file location, and the override ini file. 
The Region.ini override file also sets where to read the region xml data.
